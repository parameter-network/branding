# Parameter Brand Guidelines

This document defines the official rules for using the Parameter brand assets, including logos, icons, and visual identity elements.

Following these guidelines ensures consistency and protects the integrity of the Parameter brand.

---

## 1. Official Brand Assets

Only assets provided in the official repository are considered valid:

https://github.com/parameter-network/branding

Do not use logos from unofficial sources or recreate them manually.

---

## 2. Logo Concept

The Parameter logo is a **typographic mark** represented as:

p(x)

It references mathematical functions, parameters, and formal systems, reflecting the technical and deterministic nature of the Parameter blockchain.

The parentheses `( )` are a **core semantic and visual element** of the logo.

---

## 3. Logo Variants

The following official variants are provided:

- **Primary logo** — `p(x)` in dark color on light background
- **Light version** — `p(x)` in white for dark backgrounds
- **Dark version** — `p(x)` in black for light backgrounds
- **Monochrome versions** — pure black or pure white only
- **Icon version** — simplified mark for small sizes and square formats

Always choose the version that provides sufficient contrast and readability.

---

## 4. Preferred Formats

- **SVG** — preferred for all digital usage (web, apps, UI)
- **PNG** — use only when SVG is not supported
- **PDF** — print and high-resolution export

Do not convert raster images back into vector formats.

---

## 4. Clear Space & Sizing

Maintain sufficient clear space around the logo to preserve readability.

- Minimum clear space: equal to the height of the logo icon
- Do not place text, graphics, or UI elements inside this area
- The logo must always remain legible and unobstructed

Avoid using the logo at sizes where details become unclear.

## 5. Background Usage

- Use **dark logo** on light backgrounds
- Use **light logo** on dark backgrounds
- Avoid noisy, low-contrast, or patterned backgrounds
- Do not place the logo over images unless readability is guaranteed

If in doubt, use a solid background.
