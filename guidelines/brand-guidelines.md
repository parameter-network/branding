# Parameter Brand Guidelines

This document defines the official rules for using the Parameter brand assets, including logos, icons, and visual identity elements.

Following these guidelines ensures consistency and protects the integrity of the Parameter brand.

---

## 1. Official Brand Assets

Only assets provided in the official repository are considered valid:

https://github.com/parameter-network/branding

Do not use logos from unofficial sources or recreate them manually.

---

## 2. Logo Concept

The Parameter logo is a **typographic mark** represented as:

p(x)

It references mathematical functions, parameters, and formal systems, reflecting the technical and deterministic nature of the Parameter blockchain.

The parentheses `( )` are a **core semantic and visual element** of the logo.

---

## 3. Logo Variants

The following official variants are provided:

- **Primary logo** — `p(x)` in dark color on light background
- **Light version** — `p(x)` in white for dark backgrounds
- **Dark version** — `p(x)` in black for light backgrounds
- **Monochrome versions** — pure black or pure white only
- **Icon version** — simplified mark for small sizes and square formats

Always choose the version that provides sufficient contrast and readability.

---

## 4. Preferred Formats

- **SVG** — preferred for all digital usage (web, apps, UI)
- **PNG** — use only when SVG is not supported
- **PDF** — print and high-resolution export

Do not convert raster images back into vector formats.

---

## 5. Clear Space & Sizing

To preserve legibility, maintain clear space around the logo.

- Minimum clear space: equal to the height of the letter `p`
- No text, graphics, or UI elements may enter this area
- The logo must always remain unobstructed and readable

Avoid using the logo at sizes where the parentheses or letterforms lose clarity.

---

## 6. Do Not Modify the Logo

You may **not**:

- Change colors or apply gradients
- Alter proportions or aspect ratio
- Modify the parentheses `( )`
- Remove or isolate individual characters
- Rotate, skew, stretch, or crop the logo
- Add shadows, outlines, or visual effects
- Animate the logo without explicit approval

The logo must always be used **exactly as provided**.

---

## 7. Background Usage

- Use dark logo variants on light backgrounds
- Use light logo variants on dark backgrounds
- Avoid noisy, patterned, or low-contrast backgrounds
- Do not place the logo over images unless readability is guaranteed

When in doubt, use a solid background.

---

## 8. Acceptable Use

You may use Parameter brand assets for:

- Exchanges, wallets, and explorers
- Technical integrations and documentation
- Articles, reviews, and educational content
- Presentations and ecosystem overviews

All usage must clearly and truthfully refer to the Parameter network.

---

## 9. Prohibited Use

You may **not** use the brand assets:

- In a misleading or deceptive context
- To imply endorsement, partnership, or affiliation without permission
- In connection with illegal, fraudulent, or harmful activities

---
